Description: Functionality for working with virtual machines in Microsoft's 'Azure' cloud. Includes facilities to create, startup, shutdown, and cleanly delete VMs and VM clusters. With a running VM, execute scripts and install optional extensions. A selection of VM templates based on the 'Data Science Virtual Machine' are supplied; users can thus quickly create and use a VM preinstalled with several software packages useful for data science. Also works with user-supplied templates.
